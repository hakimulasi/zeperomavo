Towards the end of the slideshow, all three Detroit spitters posed for an assortment of photos.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Skilla Baby joked around in his caption and wrote: “I don’t know why these two random n-ggas keep jumping in my pictures.”</p><p>Tee Grizzley and Sada Baby also reposted the photos on their respective IG pages, with the “First Day Out” rapper <a href=# rel=noopener>saying</a>: “It’s bigger than us [100 emoji] #Detroit [bear emoji, tent and tree emoji, and gorilla emoji].”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Sada <a href=# rel=noopener>added</a>: “Amends And Amen [praying hands emoji] [bruised heart emoji].”</p><p>Skilla Baby wasn’t the only one who welcomed the reconciliation as Boldy James, Hit-Boy and Bfb Da Packman applauded the pair via Instagram comments.</p><p>While their reunion is a welcome sight, especially in Detroit, things weren’t always peaceful between Tee Grizzley and Sada Baby.</p><p>There have been reports that their beef started in 2018 but details have been scarce.&nbsp;Both Detroit rhymers were managed by the late Jobina “JB” Brown, Tee’s aunt, <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>who was killed in 2019</a>.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>In an exclusive interview with HipHopDX in 2020, <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>Sada Baby discussed being featured on Big Sean’s Detroit 2 track “Friday Night Cypher” and how he didn’t care for Tee Grizzley’s bars.</a></p><p>“So what happened was, I was in L.A. I pulled up to fuck with Sean, just to kick it with him and play what I had been working on, just a bunch of unreleased shit,”&nbsp; Sada explained. “And he wanted me to hear the album. So he played me the album and some other shit. But he played me the album and it was crazy. It was fire, that shit was amazing.

That’s all who was on there. At the time, he wasn’t offering me to get on the song. He just let me hear it. I was like, that’s cool. I liked it.</p><p>He continued: “Immediately, I felt I would fuck him up [Tee Grizzley] on that bitch because he was saying some bullshit. But I wasn’t tripping. I was cool with the fact that he let me hear his album before it came out. So I didn’t give a fuck if he was going to include me in it or not. I can guarantee you every fucking body on that song ain’t sat in this seat right here and listened to his whole album.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“I’m not saying that I don’t know if I wouldn’t have did it if I had heard the other verses first, but I think he’s smart enough to have let me do my shit first before adding the people he added. I feel I’m better than Tee so I be ready to get on some shit and fuck him up.”</p><p>Sada threw more shots at Grizzley’s rapping ability, saying: “He lucky they cut a couple of his bars off, he had a poo-butt ass bar because he said some bullshit. He took shit off the end. But not for one second was I shying away because Tee was on there. I never was afraid of his chest.”</p><p>Regardless of their past, fans are currently rejoicing that all is now well between both of the young Detroit rap legends.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mirnp1dnL%2BqxtmlnLJlo5axonnBmpmyZaOmwqK%2Fx2aZnp2WYsCstculmGaakZfG</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftee-grizzley-sada-baby-squash-beef-skilla-baby.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftee-grizzley-sada-baby-squash-beef-skilla-baby.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftee-grizzley-sada-baby-squash-beef-skilla-baby.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftee-grizzley-sada-baby-squash-beef-skilla-baby.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftee-grizzley-sada-baby-squash-beef-skilla-baby.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftee-grizzley-sada-baby-squash-beef-skilla-baby.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./today-new-host-revealed-meet-nbc-family-studio-1a.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./today-new-host-revealed-meet-nbc-family-studio-1a.html>Today's new host revealed - meet latest permanent member of Studio 1A</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./slow-joe-doyle.html>Slow Joe Doyle</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./slow-joe-doyle.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
