In August, they were married on a Florida beach.</p><p>Three months after their wedding, the couple may be seen in court again since Robert has been accused of abusing a teammate during the Olympics.</p><p>After the allegations against him were made public last week, the 25-year-old Paralympic athlete from the United States remained silent.</p><p>Parker Egbert, a 19-year-old swimmer with autism and an intellectual handicap, has yet to reply to Griswold’s lawsuit. And the two-time gold medalist has harmed the lives of two people, one of whom is his wife, whom he was dating prior to committing this act.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.current-affairs.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Robert-Griswold.jpg><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;<a href=#>Michael Malone (Nuggets Head Coach) &amp;amp; His Wife Jocelyn Malone Have Two Daughters</a></strong></p><h2 id=robert-griswold-and-wife-abby-newland-had-their-wedding-in-august><span class=ez-toc-section id=Robert_Griswold_And_Wife_Abby_Newland_Had_Their_Wedding_In_August></span>Robert Griswold And Wife Abby Newland Had Their Wedding In August<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In August, Robert Griswold married his bride, Abby Newland. After a little more than a year of dating, the couple married.</p><p>After meeting at a swimming competition in 2021, Robert and Abby began to develop feelings for each other. Robert has shared various images of himself and his wife on Facebook, ranging from their first date through their wedding ceremony.</p><p>He got more socially involved after his relationship with Abby. Previously, the Paralympian US athlete did not appear to communicate much about his personal life on social media. He exclusively shared photos of himself on the podium.</p><p>On June 2, 2022, the 25-year-old proposed to his then-girlfriend in a swimming pool. He captioned the proposal photographs, “The only thing about you that I’d change is your (last) name.”</p><p>They married a little over a month later in New Smyrna Beach, Florida, in front of their family and friends. Robert was overjoyed in the wedding photos since he had married his best buddy.</p><h2 id=robert-griswold-wife-abby-newland><span class=ez-toc-section id=Meet_Robert_Griswold_Wife_Abby_Newland></span>Meet Robert Griswold Wife Abby Newland<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Abby Griswold is Robert Griswold’s wife. On August 14, last year, she married him.</p><p>Abby Newland is her maiden name. They’ve been married for less than four months and have already encountered a stumbling block. Will she continue to love and appreciate him, as she promised in her wedding vows? Time will only tell.</p><p>Since the allegations against her husband were made public, Abby has received a flood of supporting comments and condolences for marrying a man like Robert. Many people have already made comments on Robert’s Facebook wall.</p><p>Parker Egbert accused Robert of sexually abusing him during the Tokyo Paralympics in 2021 earlier this week. Since the allegations surfaced, Griswold’s team has remained silent.</p><p>Abby, whose full name is Abigail, avoids social media. She has only ever used social media with her hubby. And the final image was of the couple who had married earlier this year.</p><p>Abigail began dating Robert before he left with the US Team to Japan in August-September for the Paralympics Olympics. And she was enthralled when her then-boyfriend won two gold medals.</p><p>Knowing that a loved one is waiting for you at home, but then doing what Robert did to a colleague during training camp is awful. He has shattered the lives of a young swimmer and his wife, Abby, who could never have imagined such an incident in her wildest dreams.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Robert_Griswold_Net_Worth_In_2022></span>Robert Griswold Net Worth In 2022<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Robert Griswold’s net worth is predicted to be $1.5 million as of 2022.
