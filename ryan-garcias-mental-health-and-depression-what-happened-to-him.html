The WBC interim lightweight title Garcia held from January to May 2021 is well known.</p><p>As of October 2021, he was rated the fifth-best active lightweight in the world by The Ring magazine, the Transnational Boxing Rankings Board, ESPN, and BoxRec. Garcia started boxing at seven and continued until he turned professional on June 9, 2016, at 17.</p><p>The boxer faced Edgar Meza in Tijuana for his first match as a professional. He defeated Meza by technical knockout, and in November 2016, he signed with Golden Boy Promotions.</p><h2 id=ryan-garcias-mental-healt>Ryan Garcia's Mental Health And Depression: What Happened To Him?</h2><p>Boxing champion Ryan Garcia discussed his battles with&nbsp;<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener>depression</a> and mental health issues before his April matchup with Emmanuel Tagoe. The 23-year-old fighter revealed he once had suicidal thoughts when appearing on Inside Boxing Live with Dan Canobbio.</p><p>"When deep in it, he didn't think he was going to live." "He developed unhealthy habits and was depressed." Ryan started drinking after never having done so before. But he was constantly intoxicated and, at one point, contemplated suicide. "</p><p>[image-1]</p><p>Garcia dropped out of the fight in April 2021 because of sadness and anxiety, even though he was supposed to fight Javier Fortuna in July 2021. At the time, he stated that he was looking for professional assistance to help him become "a stronger version of myself."</p><p>The unbeaten lightweight admitted to Canobbio that his problems were caused by poor stress management and a lack of a strong support structure, but he is now much better off. Despite not having fought in over a year, Garcia is still one of boxing's quickest-rising stars.</p><h2 id=who-is-ryan-garcias-baby->Who Is Ryan Garcia's Baby Mama And Daughter?</h2><p>Garcia's daughter was born in March 2019, and although he was already highly successful at that point, he lists the birth of his child as the most significant event in his life.</p><p>According to the Daily Press, Ryan said the following about his daughter. After the kid was born, Ryan broke up with Catherine Gamez, the mother of his daughter. Ryan tried his best to make the relationship work, but he was unsuccessful, according to a string of tweets he posted.&nbsp;</p><p>[image-2]</p><p>The chances of Ryan Garcia's 3-year-old daughter Rylie being a fighter in the future are nil to none, says the child's mother, Catherine Gamez, who also tells TMZ Sports that the fighter doesn't want it to happen.</p><p>If you look through Ryan's Instagram, you'll see lots of sweet pictures of his daughter. In pictures together, the father and daughter appear so adorable.</p><p>We can categorically state that Rylie is incredibly fortunate to have a father who is so devoted and thoughtful. Ryan enjoys being with his daughter and making sure she is content.</p><h2 id=where-is-ryan-garcia-now>Where Is Ryan Garcia Now?</h2><p>Ryan Garcia is still shining in his career as an MMA&nbsp;<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener>fighter</a>.
