<time>10 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>In 2018, a 9-year-old Canadian girl gained widespread attention after posting a series of provocative photos and videos to Instagram. Lil Tay, as Claire Eileen Qi Hope, rose to fame on Instagram by flaunting a rich lifestyle and uploading pictures of herself next to flashy vehicles and mansions while yelling expletives and even racist slurs into the camera.</p><p>Lil Tay had a huge Instagram following and once called herself the youngest “flexer in the century,” but she apparently had to end her “career” due to custody problems and brand rights issues. In 2018, she stopped actively using social media, only to reappear in 2021 with a worrying message.</p><p>The young celebrity and her brother’s deaths were then announced on her Instagram page in August of 2023. <strong>What happened to Lil Tay?</strong> What little information we have regarding this awful event is as follows.</p><h2>Did Something Happen to Lil Tay?</h2><p><strong>In the summer of 2018, Lil Tay suddenly stopped posting on her social media accounts after months of doing so every day.</strong> At the time, the rapper’s Instagram claimed that her father, Christopher Hope, had filed a court request to have his daughter returned to Vancouver.</p><p><strong>This was the last post she shared on her Instagram while she was alive:</strong></p><p>Angela Tian, Lil Tay’s mom, said the two haven’t had a good connection and have been apart since her daughter was a year old. The young girl told that her father had threatened to have her mother arrested if they didn’t return. I lost touch with him for a long time. After not seeing me for so long, it’s clear he’s only back because he needs money.</p><p>Chris’s representative Harry Tsang told the outlet at the time of the court order to return to Canada that Chris’s father was not trying to make money off of his daughter in any way, shape, or form. No more ridiculous videos of Tay swearing, please. Second, a Tay-specific trust fund will get 25% of all revenue. And finally, he argued, “Her operation, her public image, needs structure.”</p><p><strong>Take a look at below tweet:</strong></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>The Vancouver and Los Angeles Police Departments have denied they’re investigating the death of Lil Tay, claims they have no record of her death and have not been alerted of her death <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/19mTvuOXbU</a></p><p>— No Jumper (@nojumper) <a href=# rel=noopener>August 9, 2023</a></p><p>Her brother Jason Tian, who has been suspected of teaching his sister in her controversial films, has been the subject of much speculation among her fans.</p><p><strong>You can also take a look at the below posts we have provided for you:</strong></p><h2>Little Tay Cause of Death</h2><p>How did Little Tay perish? <strong>Lil Tay’s cause of death is unknown.</strong> Her family has requested privacy as authorities continue their investigation into her and her brother’s deaths.</p><p><strong>Take a look at below post:</strong></p><h2>Why is Lil Tay So Popular?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Why-is-Lil-Tay-So-Popular.webp><p>Videos showing Lil Tay cussing, picking fights with other Internet celebrities, and otherwise enjoying the high life went viral, catapulting her to fame. Her reported background reads as follows, according to the Cut: “She grew up ‘poor as hell’ in Atlanta but worked incredibly hard moving bricks. At last, she was accepted to Harvard, when she abruptly left.</p><p>She has over 3,300,000 Instagram followers and has worked with popular YouTuber Jake Paul and music producer Rick Rubin. She discussed her own internet fame in an interview with GMA in 2018. She was only nine years old, but she was already the youngest flexer in the industry, so “people think it’s funny, I guess, ’cause I’m 9 years old and I’ve accomplished so much,” she said. I have complete freedom of action. I don’t care if they don’t believe me.
