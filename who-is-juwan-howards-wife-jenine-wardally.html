We will shortly go into the details of her life, but first, let’s look at her profile summary.<br></p><h3><strong>Summary of Jenine Wardally’s Biography</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Jenine Wardally</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Female</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> February 7, 1975</li><li><strong>Jenine Wardally’s Age:</strong> 48 years old</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> African American</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Aquarius</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation: </strong>Straight</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Christian</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Married</li><li><strong>Jenine Wardally’s Husband:</strong> Juwan Howard</li><li><strong>Jenine Wardally’s Children:</strong> Jace Howard and Jett Howard</li><li><strong>Jenine Wardally’s Parents:</strong> George Wardally (father) and Jermin Ruby (mother)</li><li><strong>Siblings: </strong>Liesha, Shakira, and Maya</li><li><strong>Jenine Wardally’s Weight:</strong> 56 kg</li><li><strong>Jenine Wardally’s Net Worth:</strong> $1 million</li><li><strong>Famous for:</strong> Being Juwan Howard’s Wife</li><li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Writer, Singer, Businesswoman</li><li><strong>Jenine Wardally’s Instagram:</strong> @jeninehoward</li><li><strong>Twitter:</strong> @J9Howard</li></ul><h2><strong>Though Born in the Caribbean, The 48-Year-Old is a Native of Brooklyn, New York</strong></h2><p>Jenine Wardally’s birth story is a little unique. She was born in Grenada on February 7, 1975, to Caribbean-American parents – George Wardally and Ruby Jermin. Her dad was an airplane pilot while her mother was a professional singer who sang with a music group called ‘The Lollipops.’ As a fairly famous Motown era singer, Ruby Jermin had even sang back-up for the “Jackson Five” and toured Europe a lot.</p><p>Jenine was the second of four daughters, and when she was about five years old, her parents moved from Grenada and settled in Brooklyn, where she and her three sisters were eventually raised. Jenine is of African American descent and phenotypically appears as a light-skinned black woman.</p><p>The entrepreneur and author has somehow managed to keep the details about her education away from the public. So there is no verifiable information about where she schooled and when she graduated college. However, we know that her three sisters are named Liesha, Shakira, and Maya Wardally. And although she hasn’t exactly confirmed it, it’s believed that Jenine studied Arts in an unnamed University in New York.</p><h2><strong>Jenine Wardally Has Been Married to Juwan Howard Since 2002</strong></h2><p>By now, you know that Jenine is married to the iconic Juwan Howard. Although the year they met isn’t exactly known, Juwan and Jenine met way back in the nineties. At the time, he was barely two years into playing for the NBA, and Jenine was in the process of recording her debut solo album.</p><p>They met at a party hosted by Alonzo Harding, who happened to be Juwan’s co-player at the NBA. The two started a solid romantic relationship, and before long, they had welcomed their first son, Jeff, together.</p><p>They got married in 2002 and have remained wholly committed to each other. In fact, the marriage has been so devoid of all the scandal and nasty allegations that usually plague high-profile marriages like theirs.</p><h3><strong>Juwan Howard Is A </strong><strong>Hugely Successful NBA Legend</strong></h3><p>Juwan Howard was born in Chicago, Illinois, 50 years ago on February 7, 1973. He has retired from active basketball for some time now, but this is because the most impressive part of his career happened between 1990 and 2000.</p><p>Howard famously played for the Michigan Wolverines from 1991 to 1994 before being recruited into the Washington Bullets in 1994. The following year, he left the Bullets and moved over to play for several other teams in the NBA, including Portland, Charlotte, Miami, Dallas, Denver, and Houston.</p><p>He was the first NBA athlete to get a $100 million contract and at one point earned as much as $15 million per annum as a player. He was one of the Michigan Fab Five and is currently the only black coach among the Big 10. Between 2013 and 2019, Juwan was made the assistant coach for the Miami Heat club, a position that sparked his love for teaching.</p><p>He finally decided to make this dream a reality by going back to his alma mater (University of Michigan) and taking up a position as the head coach of the college’s basketball team. Juwan Howard’s six-foot-six frame was indeed a blessing, earning him multiple championship wins and facilitating his early induction into the Hall of Fame in 1986.</p><h2><strong>Jenine Wardally Is A Multipotentialite As She Has Several Feathers On Her Career Hat</strong></h2><p>On her Instagram bio, Mrs. Howard describes herself as many things, including a singer, fashion enthusiast, anti-cancer crusader, philanthropist, and businesswoman, and she is genuinely all these and more.</p><p>Shortly after Jenine left high school, she decided to pursue music professionally and created a music band named ‘Onome.’ The group was signed to Epic Records and was on the verge of releasing their first album when they were unceremoniously dropped from the label.</p><p>The group disbanded shortly after this, and Jenine decided to pursue her music solo. However, it was a very uphill task, and the album took a long time before it was finally ready. In the meantime, she operated a medical spa and started her own CBD company.</p><p>Although Jenine’s music career didn’t skyrocket as she’d hoped, the 48-year-old found fulfillment in other ventures that we can see today. Especially her annually held Miami Fashion Show and her Miami-based charity, The Juice Foundation.</p><p>She has also written a couple of novels, including the bestselling thrillers Sons of the Dawns and its follow-up, ‘Sons of the Dawn: A Basque Odyssey.’ Currently, Jenine is believed to have amassed wealth to the tune of a million dollars. This does not include the $100 million net worth that she shares with her husband, Juwan.</p><h3><strong>The Couple Jointly Run a Non-Profit Charity Organization called ‘The Juice Foundation’</strong></h3><p>Together, Jenine Wardally and Juwan Howard launched a foundation dubbed “The Juice Foundation” in memory of Juwan’s friend and colleague, Lamont ‘Juice’ Carter. The latter came down with stage 4 esophageal cancer in 2011. The foundation offered to provide research and relief materials to those battling cancer in Miami.</p><p>They were able to set the charity organization up with contributions from health stores, local farmers, medical equipment suppliers, and other investors. The foundation made it a point of duty to research alternative and natural remedies for cancer and develop balanced diets for folks who wanted to manage their cancer and those who hoped to prevent it.</p><p>They were able to extend Juice’s life by almost 18 months instead of the five months predicted by the doctors. Currently, the foundation isn’t quite as active as it used to be, and this is because the couple moved from their previous Miami base to Michigan, where Juwan now plies his trade. It seems like it will take a little while before they get settled enough to resume full operations in the charity.</p><h2><strong>Jenine and Juwan’s Children Are Two Young Adult Sons</strong></h2><p>Jenine and her husband, Juwan, welcomed their first son together, Jace Howard, on September 19, 2001. He was born nearly a year before his parents tied the knot. Their second son, Jett Howard, followed two years later in 2003, and both boys have taken after their father’s major league basketball ways.</p><p>On the one hand, Jace (22) is a major player for the University of Michigan, a dream he’d had since he was a little boy. He is also studying International Business at the university. On the other hand, Jett is a graduate of Montverde Academy in Florida and has decided to join his big brother and make his name in Michigan basketball.</p><p>Juwan also has four other kids, two sons and two daughters, all from different mothers. They include Juwan Jr. Howard, whose mother, Martina Blyden, was Michigan’s ‘Miss Basketball,’ Joshua Howard, Sky Howard, and Star Howard, who Juwan had with ex-girlfriend Kristy Wilmot.</p><p>All of them are grown up now, and although most of them live with their mothers, they all find love and warmth in Jenine’s house whenever they need it.</p><h3><strong>Jenine Wardally is Quite Active on Social Media, Especially on Instagram</strong></h3><p>The celebrity wife maintains a meaningful presence on social media, and you will find her pages littered with pictures of her family and work. On Instagram, Jenine Wardally has about 53k followers, while on Twitter, she has managed to gather over 13k followers.</p><p>Her posts range from a myriad of topics like her love for her family to her philanthropic activities and her devotion to better community health, and she doesn’t hold anything back from her followers. All of which makes her one of the truest philanthropists ever.</p><h2><strong>FAQs about Jenine Wardally</strong></h2><li><strong>Who is Jenine Wardally?</strong> Jenine Wardally is Juwan Howard’s wife.
