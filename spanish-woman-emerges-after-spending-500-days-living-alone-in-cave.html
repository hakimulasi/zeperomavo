Asked how she had succeeded in keeping herself sane for so long, Flamini pointed to her extensive experience and mental preparation, adding: “I got on very well with myself.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Yes, she had talked to herself – but never out loud. After all, the silence of the cave (“it wasn’t my house”) had to be respected. The key, she added, was consistency.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“For me at least, as an elite extreme sportswoman, the most important thing is being very clear and consistent about what you think and what you feel and what you say,” she said. “It’s true that there were some difficult moments, but there were also some very beautiful moments – and I had both as I lived up to my commitment to living in a cave for 500 days.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Flamini said she passed the time calmly and purposefully by reading, writing, drawing, knitting – by enjoying herself: “I was where I wanted to be, and so I dedicated myself to it.” Put bluntly, the trick was living in the here and now: “I’m cooking; I’m drawing … You have to be focused. If I get distracted, I’ll twist my ankle. I’ll get hurt. It’ll be over and they’ll have to get me out. And I don’t want that.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>She had managed to keep fit, plough through 60 books and use two cameras to chronicle her experiences for a forthcoming documentary.</p><figure id=11ad2464-ad77-4398-bd4c-830b2b091b13 data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Flamini opening one of her food deliveries. The athlete described how she was seized by a longing for roast chicken.</span> Photograph: Dokumalia Producciones/Reuters</figure><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>But surely there had been some unpalatable moments – times when she was tempted to hit the panic button and head back into the light?</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Flamini thought for a moment and then remembered one particular insect incursion.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“The flies! The flies! The flies!” she said. “There was an invasion of flies. They came in, they laid their larvae and I didn’t control it and so I suddenly ended up enveloped by flies. It wasn’t that complicated, but it wasn’t healthy … but that’s just what it was.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>While she fell victim to an intense craving for roast chicken with potatoes, the solitude was less of a problem. Before she entered the cave, she told her team that she did not want to be told what was going on outside, even if it involved the loss of a loved one.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“The people who know me and love me respect that,” she said. “There’s no problem.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Flamini sounded ever so slightly irked when recounting how she felt when the moment came to leave the cave. “I was sleeping – or at least dozing – when they came down to get me … I thought something had happened. I said: ‘Already? No way.’ I hadn’t finished my book.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Nor was she dazzled by the daylight of the Andalucían spring. And it hadn’t just been the dark glasses she wore.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“I didn’t feel anything when I saw the light because to me it felt like I’d only just gone in there, so I didn’t have that sensation of missing the light and the sun and all that’s out there,” she said. “I’m being honest – I’m not going to lie.”</p><figure id=bc005991-9db3-450e-b90b-08733c38352a data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Flamini at the press conference: ‘I could go another 500 days.’</span> Photograph: Alba Feixas/EPA</figure><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Just as revelations and insights were beginning to appear elusive, someone plucked up the courage to ask the question on everyone’s mind. What about the, er, toilet arrangements down there?</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Flamini, to no one’s surprise by that point, was unflappable, explaining that she had left her bodily waste at the collection point “every five poos”. A round of applause rang out.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“There was no other way and five was my limit,” she said. “You have to get the waste out. I left my offerings there, as if to the gods, and the gods left me food.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>She was equally phlegmatic about the long-delayed wash: “I still haven’t showered. But then, I’m an extreme sportswoman. I could go another 500 days.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The defiant athlete – and, pending official confirmation, record-breaker – had appeared baffled by her questioners only once. Why had she looked so happy when she emerged from the cave?</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“How would you feel if you had a dream and you fulfilled it?” she replied. “Would you come out crying?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaK%2Bfp7mle5FpaWxnkaW%2FcH2TaKqpmZ6ewKl51qikmqZdmrqmvsaeqmaZlqmys3nSqZynnJmjtG6Bj2lknZmpqHqttdWipaBlkaG8r7GMoqVmm5Grsg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fspanish-woman-emerges-after-spending-500-days-living-alone-in-cave.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fspanish-woman-emerges-after-spending-500-days-living-alone-in-cave.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fspanish-woman-emerges-after-spending-500-days-living-alone-in-cave.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fspanish-woman-emerges-after-spending-500-days-living-alone-in-cave.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fspanish-woman-emerges-after-spending-500-days-living-alone-in-cave.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fspanish-woman-emerges-after-spending-500-days-living-alone-in-cave.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./vanessa-williams-net-worth-2020-2021.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./vanessa-williams-net-worth-2020-2021.html>Vanessa Williams Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./lauren-comeau-stirs-up-new-pregnancy-rumors-after-getting-back-with-javi-marroquin.html>Lauren Comeau Stirs Up New Pregnancy Rumors After Getting Back With Javi Marroquin</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./lauren-comeau-stirs-up-new-pregnancy-rumors-after-getting-back-with-javi-marroquin.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
