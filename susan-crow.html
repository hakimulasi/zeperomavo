Susan Crown and Tony Bennett are one of them. The duo has a 40-year age gap between them and while Benett is 96, Susan is 56 years old as of 2023. A teacher and philanthropist, Susan is as far away from the entertainment industry as she can be and her only link to the industry comes from her husband, Tony Bennett. While the pair’s age group leaves most fans bewildered, there is nothing more to it. The pair have enjoyed a remarkable two decades of togetherness and are sure to take it all the way. In this article, we will take a closer look at the wiki-bio of Susan Crow.</p><p><strong>Susan Crow is an American Philanthropist and teacher who is popular as the wife of Tony Bennett.</strong> <strong>Her zodiac is Virgo. On the physical side of things, Susan has a standing height of around 5 feet 7 inches, a slim athletic body, and her eyes are brown.&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Tony-Bennett-wife-Susan-Crow.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Early Life:</h2><p>Susan Crow was born on the 9th of September 1966 in San Fransisco, California. Born to Dayl and Marion Crow, Susan spent most of her early life in San Fransico. Her father worked as an Insurance agent while her mother stayed back home. Susan, who attended a local high school, was an athletic kid and played regular tennis. She matriculated in 1984 before enrolling at Fordham University and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1988. She continued her higher education at Columbia University’s Teachers College where she obtained her Master’s Degree in 1990.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Professional Career:</h2><p>Susan wanted to become a teacher from a very young age and made sure that her education matched her profession. Not long after meeting her future husband, Tony, Susan became a philanthropist and helped him to found the Exploring The Arts (ETA) organization. Since its establishment in 1999, the organization has helped build over 17 schools around the US and encourages students to study arts. Susan serves as the board president and oversees the philanthropic activities of the organization. In 2010, both Susan and Tony were awarded the George Washington University Medals. Alongside her work at ETA, Susan also owns and operates a creative agency entitled Creative Artists Management and located in New York.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Personal Life:</h2><p>Tony and Susan first met in the late ’80s and were introduced by their mutual friend, Lady Gaga. The pair began dating in secret and it was only after 20 years of dating that Tony divorced his ex-wife Sandra and tied the knot with Susan in a private ceremony attended only by the late former governor of New York, Mario Cuomo, and his wife. While the duo does not have any children of their own, Susan is a stepmother to four of Tony’s children.</p><p>Apart from her work life as a teacher and philanthropist, Susan is also huge on charity work. Over the years, Susan has helped countless organizations around the globe and several causes including the education of underprivileged children, and war veterans. She is often seen accompanying her husband as they tour around the globe not just for charity but a rare few of Tony’s concerts. While Susan likes to sing herself, she is nowhere near Tony, in fact, no one is quite near Tony.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A biography of her husband, Tony Bennett:</h2><p>Tony Bennett is an American retired singer, painter, and founder of the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts. He was born Anthony Dominick Benedetto on August 3, 1926, in Astoria, Queens, New York.
