He is best known for tracks like "Beautiful Girls," "Fire Burning," and "Eenie Meenie." Sean's career began when he was discovered on MySpace in the mid-2000s. After he secured a record deal, Kingston released a number of tracks and albums that charted well in both the US and the UK. He continued to release music as of 2020.</p><p>Outside of his musical achievements, Kingston is known for his financial and legal issues. Despite being a popular musician, Sean has struggled with wealth management over the years. Court documents eventually revealed that he was in seriously dire straits in a period ranging from 2016 to 2017.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Kisean <a href=# title="Paul Anderson Net Worth">Paul Anderson</a> was born on February 3rd of 1990 in Miami, Florida. Raised alongside two siblings, Kisean eventually moved to Kingston, Jamaica with his family at the age of 6. As a teen, he attended Ocho Rios High School in Jamaica before moving back to the United States. Anderson was born into a musical family, as his father was the famed reggae producer Jack Ruby.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>In the mid-2000s, Kingston was discovered on Myspace and subsequently signed a record deal with Beluga Heights and Sony. During the next period, Sean was told to make his rapping more "melodic" so that it would appeal to a wider audience. In 2007, he released his first breakthrough track, "Beautiful Girls." The track topped the charts not just in the United States, but also around the world. Throughout the rest of 2007, Sean toured with artists like <a href=# title="Kelly Clarkson Net Worth">Kelly Clarkson</a> and <a href=# title="Gwen Stefani Net Worth">Gwen Stefani</a>.</p><p>Kingston followed up in 2009 with the album "Tomorrow," which featured artists like <a href=# title="Wyclef Jean Net Worth">Wyclef Jean</a> and RedOne.

After suffering injuries, he was immediately rushed to the hospital. While he eventually recovered, the rapper faced consequences for what Miami police called "careless operation" of a jet ski. He was fined $180 and was not able to ride jet skis until 2018.</p><h2 id=financial-issues><strong>Financial Issues</strong></h2><p>In March 2014, Kingston sparked rumors that he was having money troubles when his Mercedes Benz G-Class SUV was repossessed after he fell three months behind on the payments. A week later, his Bentley was repossessed outside of a Hollywood hotel. On July 28, 2014, Sean's Lamborghini was repossessed after he parked it on the street near Hollywood and Vine. Kingston reportedly had not made a payment on the Lambo for six months.</p><p>His financial issues continued. A number of jewelers soon came forward with allegations that Kingston had failed to pay them for items. One New York-based jeweler known as "Aqua Master" filed a lawsuit against Kingston and a judge ruled in his favor, ordering Sean to pay him over $300,000. Aqua Master contended that Kingston failed to pay for nine pieces of jewellery. While Sean had put down a $1,000 deposit, he failed to pay the remaining sum, Aqua Master alleged.</p><p>Kingston had been previously sued by a Florida-based jeweler who accused Sean of not paying for $48,000 worth of items. In 2015, he was sued by yet another jeweler in New York called Avi Da Jeweler. Kingston was ordered to pay Avi $356,000 in damages after he failed to pay for a number of watches. Avianne Jewelers allegedly locked Kingston in a car and drove him to a remote area before dumping him outside unceremoniously after he refused to pay the full amount for a luxury watch. The jewelers took back the watch during this incident before kidnapping allegations were made by Sean.</p><p>At least one of these jewelers was not able to receive the legal damages from Kingston because of his terrible financial situation. As a result, reports surfaced that suggested Sean's music royalties may be seized in order to pay off the sum of over $300,000 that he owed to at least one jeweler. Unfortunately, Kingston also failed to pay his lawyers during this entire ordeal. After months of publicly denying his financial and legal issues, he was forced to admit in 2017 that he was indeed broke. This came after a half-hearted attempted to flaunt his wealth on social media with the apparent purchase of a house and a new car.</p><p>While Sean didn't publicly state on social media that he was completely out of cash, he did file court documents that claimed he only had $500 in his bank accounts. One lawyer eventually reached an agreement with Kingston that involved intermittent payments of $20,000. However, Kingston failed to make these payments and therefore breached the agreement. This put Sean back in court. When the rapper failed to fill out a financial form, he was held in contempt of court.</p><p>At this point Kingston claimed to be living with his mother. He further claimed to own no property or automobiles. Many of his accounts had a negative balance, and the only income that he seemed to be making was from a one-time payment of $2,000.</p><p>In December 2020 a warrant was issued for Sean's arrest for an allegedly unpaid tab which led to charges of grand theft. According to TMZ, Kingston did not pay for several new pieces of jewelry that he had delivered.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70aKaoZ2jqXqzrc%2BpnKurX6iyorqMpKCnn6OpvK95zZ6rZq%2Bfp8Gpew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsean-kingston-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsean-kingston-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsean-kingston-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsean-kingston-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsean-kingston-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsean-kingston-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./versacemansionmiami.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./versacemansionmiami.html>The Versace mansion, Miami: true style is always in fashion</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./sandra-bullock-explains-why-coparenting-with-bryan-randall-is-hard.html>Sandra Bullock Explains Why Coparenting With Bryan Randall Is Hard</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./sandra-bullock-explains-why-coparenting-with-bryan-randall-is-hard.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
