<time>07 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><a href=#><strong>Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino </strong></a>has opened up about his past cocaine and oxycodone addiction and admitted he spent $500K to satisfy his drug habit.</p><p>“When you think of that number, when you hear that number, that’s a good college fund right there,” the Jersey Shore star, 41, <a href=# rel=noopener>told Entertainment Tonight</a> in an interview published on Monday, November 27. “I gotta just be accountable and be like, ‘Yeah, that happened.’ I was wild. I was careless. I was reckless, and I fell prey to drug addiction.”</p><p>Sorrentino shares his story in his new memoir, Reality Check: Making the Best of The Situation — How I Overcame Addiction, Loss, and Prison, due to be published December 19.</p><p>Sorrentino’s reality TV fame led to several endorsements, including clothing, liquor and vitamin brands. While earning huge paychecks, he <a href=#>served eight months in prison</a> in 2019 after pleading guilty to one count of tax evasion for not paying taxes on $9 million.</p><p>Sorrentino recalled how becoming rich pulled him into the dark side of life in the fast lane.</p><p>“I was a young and wild, careless kid, and once you gave kids millions of dollars and Ferraris and Lambos and girls screaming my name and yes-men everywhere, it was hard to turn that off,” he said. “That was my problem for many years — how do you turn off the excess? And I think it wasn’t just my problem. Most people in our world or in the celebrity world or in the entertainment world, they have a problem turning off the excess button.”</p><p>Sorrentino remembered his addiction snowballed and he was completely out of control.</p><p>“I was into everything. I had everything on me at all times in my Louis Vuitton bag. Everything — from a couple hundred Roxicet, which are 30 milligram oxycodone, then I’d have probably 150 Percocets on me, which are 10 milligram oxycodone,” he told ET. “Then I would have about 100 Xanax on me, 100 Valium, and if I wasn’t traveling on a plane maybe I would have some weed and cocaine as well, ’cause I knew that if I traveled on a plane, not a good idea to try and go through security with cocaine and weed on you.”</p><p>In May 2018, Sorrentino talked about the consequences of his drug addiction.</p><p>“I went down this road for many years. Of experimenting, partying, making bad decisions because, when you’re addicted, everything is affected by that substance,” He told the <a href=# rel=noopener>Asbury Park Press.</a> “You don’t eat correctly, you don’t sleep correctly. Your relationships are affected and you don’t even realize that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mike-The-Situation-Sorrentino-Admits-He-Spent-500K-on-Cocaine-and-Oxycodone-I-Was-Reckless-2.jpg><p>Sorrentino completed a rehabilitation program in 2012 but later suffered a relapse. He was finally able to turn his life around when sought treatment for his addiction a second time three years later.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“When I finally got to rehab in 2015 that was definitely my low, but my lowest was like a day or so before that, when I did something I never thought I was gonna do,” he remembered. “I ended up trying a drug that I never thought I would try. A drug that kills most people. A drug that most people don’t come back from. A drug that I told myself that I would never do, that I thought was dirty. It was heroin.”</p><p>Sorrentino has now been sober for eight years, and he credits his wife, <strong>Lauren Sorrentino</strong>, with whom he is <a href=#>currently expecting his third child,</a> and his mother, <strong>Linda Sorrentino</strong>, for saving him when needed help to turn his life around.</p><p>“I was depressed and [with] anxiety and self-doubt,” he said. “I had given up on myself. I just wanted to get out of that space mentally.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGamoZuaerW0xGaqoqyllsGqu81mqqiqopq7tbXNqGSsqJWjwW6Bj2miZqeeYrCwr8CipZ5lkaOxbrvXspqonJ%2Bjsm5%2Bjg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmike-the-situation-sorrentino-spent-500k-on-cocaine-and-oxycodone-2.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmike-the-situation-sorrentino-spent-500k-on-cocaine-and-oxycodone-2.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmike-the-situation-sorrentino-spent-500k-on-cocaine-and-oxycodone-2.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmike-the-situation-sorrentino-spent-500k-on-cocaine-and-oxycodone-2.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmike-the-situation-sorrentino-spent-500k-on-cocaine-and-oxycodone-2.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmike-the-situation-sorrentino-spent-500k-on-cocaine-and-oxycodone-2.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./37262-taylor-swifts-2014-vma-performance-proves-her-pop-music-revolution-is-off-to-a-shaky-start.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./37262-taylor-swifts-2014-vma-performance-proves-her-pop-music-revolution-is-off-to-a-shaky-start.html>Taylor Swift's 2014 VMA Performance Proves Her Pop Music Revolution is Off to a Shaky Start VIDE</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./marlene-dietrich-net-worth.html>Marlene Dietrich Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./marlene-dietrich-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
