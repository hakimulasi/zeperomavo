At the age of 14, she signed a contract with Ford and later modelled for Kohl’s and Nordstrom’s teen print catalogues. When she was 15, Ratajkowski started going to Disney and iCarly auditions, but she kept getting typecast as a bully or cheerleader, which prevented her from getting bigger roles.</p><p>She worked as a model and actress in Los Angeles while going to San Dieguito Academy, a high school in Encinitas. She played Tasha, Gibby’s girlfriend, in two episodes of the third season of Nickelodeon’s iCarly after playing two unremarkable movie roles (2009–2010). Her manager advised against applying for numerous acting jobs until she was able to be more picky.</p><p>Ratajkowski spent one year in 2009 at UCLA before quitting to pursue modelling full-time.<br>Later, she claimed that she did not enjoy interacting with other students and that the fine art education she received at the UCLA School of the Arts and Architecture was arbitrary and at odds with her artistic beliefs.</p><p>Ratajkowski started shooting more fashion editorials after campaigns and editorials with the photographer Tony Duran. She also appeared on the covers of several early issues of the artistic erotica magazine treats!, including the third issue’s cover in March 2012.</p><p>She attributes the two uninvited high-profile music video roles she received to that cover.<br>Later, Ratajkowski appeared in multiple versions of a 2012 Carl’s Jr. commercial with Sara Jean Underwood. She also appeared in commercials for Nikon and Carl’s Jr.</p><p>She also worked for Frederick’s of Hollywood; two of her appearances for the company are among the most well-liked videos on the company’s YouTube channel. Ratajkowski did nude and dressed art modelling for magazines, including a May 2012 shoot with Jonathan Leder.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Emily-Ratajkowski-368ca79fc3084e63b11afd8fb12d73ec.jpg alt=Emily-Ratajkowski-368ca79fc3084e63b11afd8fb12d73ec width=1358 height=1500 sizes="(max-width: 1358px) 100vw, 1358px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Ratajkowski collaborated with photographer Tony Kelly for the GQ Turkey cover in March 2013.<br>The 2013 music video “Blurred Lines” by Pharrell Williams, T.I., and Robin Thicke featured Ratajkowski.</p><p>Prior to “Blurred Lines,” Ratajkowski had roles in two other music videos: Taio Cruz’s “Fast Car” (released on November 5, 2012) and Maroon 5’s “Love Somebody” (released two months later).<br>2013 saw the release of “Love Somebody,” which was shot on January 16, and “Blurred Lines.”<br>On May 21, 2013, the “Love Somebody” music video was made available.</p><h2><strong>About Her Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Sebastian Bear McClard, an actor and filmmaker, and Emily first started dating.
