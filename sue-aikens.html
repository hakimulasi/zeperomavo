She’s now 60 years old and a proud Cancer zodiac sign. Sue’s life hasn’t been all glitz and glamour; she had a challenging start.

However, tragedy struck again when her mother passed away, leaving young Sue to fend for herself. It was in these harsh conditions that she learned the art of survival, including hunting with a gun, from an old Alaskan sourdough.</p><p>Despite her challenging upbringing, Sue managed to get a decent education. She attended the Lowell Whiteman School and completed high school at the age of thirteen.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Sue_Aikens_Career_and_Rise_to_Fame></span><strong><strong>Sue Aikens</strong> Career and Rise to Fame</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sue Aikens is a television personality and producer with several successful shows under her belt.
