How much does he make per movie?</p><p><strong>Keanu Reeves’ salary has varied greatly throughout his career. He was paid $95,000 for his role in “Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure”, compared to the $250 million he reportedly made from the two “Matrix” sequels. Much of his wealth has come from box office profit-sharing.</strong></p><p>For more on Keanu Reeves’ career in movies and how much money he has made, read on.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Bill & Ted</h2><p>For many viewers, their first exposure to Keanu Reeves was in 1989’s “Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure”, where he played Theodore “Ted” Logan.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>The film became a cult comedy classic</a>, spawning a sequel, “Bill & Ted’s Bogus Journey” a couple of years later, as well as a second sequel, “Bill & Ted Face the Music” more than thirty years later.</p><p>As one of his first roles, Reeves’ portrayal of Ted did not net him the millions he would enjoy later in his career. <a href=# rel=noopener>He was paid a reported $95,000 dollars for the role</a>, an impressive amount for a young actor but one he would later greatly surpass.</p><p>Money clearly isn’t the primary motivator for Reeves, who famously (and probably wisely) turned down a role in 1997’s “Speed 2: Cruise Control”, <a href=# rel=noopener>leaving a reported $12 million on the table in the process.</a></p><p>While Reeves is a professional actor, he is evidently not a greedy one.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Matrix</h2><p>After a relatively mixed spell in the mid-1990s, Reeves starred alongside Al Pacino in the well-received “The Devil’s Advocate” in 1997. <a href=# rel=noopener>He reportedly agreed to have his salary reduced by a few million dollars so the producers could afford to hire Al Pacino</a>.</p><p>The film was the <a href=# class=rank-math-link>beginning of his most successful period</a> financially and “The Matrix” would take his career to new heights. He was paid $10 million upfront for the first film in the trilogy but this eventually rose to $35 million from profit-sharing when it turned out to be a smash hit.</p><p>The huge success of “The Matrix” meant that Warner Bros soon greenlit a pair of sequels, to be made simultaneously and released half a year apart in 2003. It’s unclear exactly how much Reeves was paid for the sequels, though it’s believed he was being paid about $15 million per movie at the time.</p><p>In any case, the “Matrix” sequels were even greater successes, with <a href=# rel=noopener>“The Matrix Reloaded” in particular becoming the highest-grossing R-rated movie for 13 years until it was eventually overtaken by “Deadpool”</a>. As Keanu retained a sizable profit-sharing deal in his contract, <a href=# rel=noopener>it’s believed that he was paid as much as $250 million for starring in the two sequels</a>.</p><p>According to the Wall Street Journal, however, Reeves decided to donate much of his profit-sharing money to the films’ production. <a href=# rel=noopener>It’s alleged that he gave away tens of millions to the special-effects and costume-design teams</a>, saying that they deserved to be properly funded for their hard work on making the movies.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>John Wick</h2><p>Reeves’ next big series would debut a decade later with the premiere of “John Wick” in 2014. The film, which had a modest $20 million budget, saw <a href=# class=rank-math-link>Reeves reportedly</a> paid less than $2 million.</p><p>His reduction in salary was not unique to him; the majority of major film projects no longer pay their stars significant salaries upfront and prefer to backload their contracts with box office incentives. <a href=# rel=noopener>“John Wick” made $80 million globally, meaning Reeves likely made a good deal more than his initial payment</a>.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>While he received a higher salary for the sequels, about $2.5 million for “John Wick: Chapter 2”</a>, the film’s much larger $171 million worldwide gross means he probably made significantly more than he did for the original movie.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jqGmsGWdqrCpecOonKxlm5qur8GMq5yerpWoeq6typ5kqZ2iYrqwwsieZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-much-does-keanu-reeves-make-per-movie.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-much-does-keanu-reeves-make-per-movie.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-much-does-keanu-reeves-make-per-movie.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-much-does-keanu-reeves-make-per-movie.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-much-does-keanu-reeves-make-per-movie.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-much-does-keanu-reeves-make-per-movie.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./strictly-bobby-brazier-love-life-is-he-single.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./strictly-bobby-brazier-love-life-is-he-single.html>Inside Bobby Brazier's love life: from Strictly champ to EastEnders co-star</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./how-much-does-it-cost-to-frame-a-poster-at-hobby-lobby-html.html>How much does it cost to frame a poster at Hobby Lobby?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./how-much-does-it-cost-to-frame-a-poster-at-hobby-lobby-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
