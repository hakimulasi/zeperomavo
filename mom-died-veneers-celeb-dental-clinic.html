My aunt heard from the other room a man say: 'She has no pulse, she's not breathing'.</p><p>"My aunt jumped out of her chair and kneeled on the ground and started praying with my other aunt, who also attended that day for support."</p><p>Tina was taken to Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles and spent 11 days in an intensive care unit before she tragically died on March 3, 2019.</p><p>Rachael added: "It was clear through meeting with the neurologists that her brain had gone without oxygen for too long.</p><p>"It's very difficult to come to terms with the fact I only got 22 years with her on this earth, and my twin younger siblings, only 20.</p><p>"My mom was a radiant light. Everyone noticed her because she was bold, yet gracious.</p><p>"She was so joyful, outgoing, fun-loving, thoughtful, generous, a leader, a businesswoman - the list could go on forever.</p><p>"She meant everything to our family and so many people - it's hard to not have her here but she was so joy-filled and excited about life that we can't help but have that same attitude."</p><p>That day brought the most excruciating pain I have ever known - and hopefully will ever know</p><span class=quote-credit>Rachael Owens</span><p>Dr Nassar - who administered anesthesia to Tina - is being investigated by the Dental Board of California.</p><p>He faces accusations of incompetence, repeated acts of negligence and unprofessional conduct over actions taken before and during Tina’s procedure, documents show.</p><p>A spokesman for the California Department of Consumer Affairs told The Sun: "The Board is seeking the revocation or suspension of Dr Nassar’s dental license and general anesthesia permit."</p><p>The board alleges Dr Nassar did not provide an “accurate and complete” medical history for Tina.</p><p>He is also accused of failing to get written informed consent from Tina before administering anesthesia.</p><p>The board alleges Dr Nassar then failed to document “complete and accurate monitoring” of Tina when delivering the anesthetic.</p><p>It alleged between 10.45am and 10.55am, around an hour after Dr Nassar initiated intravenous anesthesia, Tina’s blood pressure and pulse measurements “appeared to be decreasing”.</p><p>He then asked the dental assistant to stop work as Tina had suffered a “sudden and significant deterioration in vital signs”, it is alleged.</p><p>Dr Nassar is then accused of failing to provide CPR quickly enough in the minutes after Tina’s vital signs failed.</p><p>He also allegedly delegated CPR to a dental assistant with “little to no clinical experience” despite having “extensive training” himself.</p><p>The board alleges these factors “attributed to the patient's anoxic brain injury and cardiac arrest”.</p><p>Paramedics arrived at around 11am and continued resuscitation efforts while rushing Tina to hospital, documents show.</p><p>But after a "prolonged course of intensive critical care", she was diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury and life support was withdrawn before she died on March 3.</p><p>A hearing has been scheduled for today at the Office of Administrative Hearings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

against Dr Sands and Dr Nassar, accusing them of wrongful death by medical negligence, fraud and battery, which has since been settled.</p><p>Court documents as part of the since-dismissed lawsuit seen by The Sun alleged: "Defendants performed a dental cosmetic procedure on decedent with anesthesia for said procedure.</p><p>"Additionally, defendants negligently performed said dental procedure leading to decedent's death.</p><p>"Defendants failed to comply with the applicable standards of care in providing dental care and treatment to decedent, both during and post-dental procedure, which led to decedent's death."</p><p>Further documents filed to Spring Street Courthouse by Mr Owens' attorney also accused the surgery of potentially forging Tina's signature to consent to be put under anesthetic.</p><p>It reads: "Plaintiff learned that he decedent, his wife, had not signed the consent form or it was fraudulently signed, or it was signed under anesthesia, for the procedures which led to her death.</p><p>"Without decedent's actual signature on the consent form, the surgery performed by the defendants was unauthorised, and was fraudulent."</p><p>The case was dismissed in 2021, however, after being resolved through a confidential settlement on undisclosed terms.</p><p>Dr Sands and Dr Nassar denied all allegations made against them in the civil complaint.</p><p>Dr Sands has been "the top cosmetic dentist of choice for some of the biggest names in entertainment for more than 15 years", according to his website.</p><p>At his practice, porcelain dental veneers cost on average between $2,000 (£1,660) to $5,000 (£4,150) each.</p><p>The price of porcelain crowns, meanwhile, usually ranges between $1,000 (£830) and $3,000 (£2,490) per crown.</p><p>His clinic sits in the heart of Beverly Hills, surrounded by high-end designer stores including Gucci, Cartier and Louis Vuitton.</p><p>The cosmetic dentist also has an office in Dubai.</p><p>According to his website, his clinics offer "star quality treatment" in a "state-of-the-art facility".</p><p>It adds: "Our office is focused on providing you with a comfortable experience, during which you can relax knowing your every dental need is being attended to.</p><p>"Dr Sands and his extraordinary team provide an attentive VIP experience every time you visit our office.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title
